## 📊 First 3 Days: The Reality

### Most Likely Scenario: $0 - $50

**Why so low?**

1. **New Account Penalty**
   - TikTok doesn't trust new accounts
   - Initial videos get 10-500 views max
   - Algorithm needs time to understand your content
   - Takes 1-2 weeks to build momentum

2. **Affiliate Conversion Math**
   - Need ~10,000 views for 1 conversion (0.01% rate)
   - 60 accounts × 3 videos/day = 180 videos
   - 180 videos × 200 avg views = 36,000 views
   - 36,000 views × 0.01% = 3-4 conversions
   - 3-4 conversions × $15 avg = **$45-$60**

3. **Trust Factor**
   - People don't buy from accounts they just discovered
   - Need multiple touchpoints
   - Brand awareness takes time
   - First 3 days = awareness phase, not sales phase

### Optimistic Scenario: $50 - $200

- Revenue: **$100-$200**

### Best Case Scenario: $200 - $500

- Multiple videos go viral (50,000+ views)
- Content is exceptionally engaging
- AFFILIFY has strong market fit
- You hit a trending topic
- TikTok algorithm favors your content

**Math:**
- 10-20 videos go viral (50,000+ views each)
